Yep. Here’s a Replit prompt that will rebuild from scratch (no repo drama), using phnompenhopera.com as the reference vibe, and output something you can deploy.

Copy/paste this into Replit (Agent / AI chat):

Replit prompt (full rebuild)

Build a bilingual festival website from scratch for Phnom Penh Opera, inspired by https://www.phnompenhopera.com/ but cleaner and more premium.

Stack
	•	Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
	•	Tailwind CSS
	•	Static/SSG-friendly (avoid server-only features unless necessary)

Routing + locales

Support locales en and km using URL prefix routes:
	•	/en and /km (Home)
	•	/en/programme and /km/programme
	•	/en/programme/don-giovanni and /km/programme/don-giovanni
	•	/en/the-festival and /km/the-festival
	•	/en/sustainability and /km/sustainability
	•	/en/cast and /km/cast
	•	/en/sponsors and /km/sponsors
	•	/en/contact and /km/contact
	•	/en/terms-of-service and /km/terms-of-service

Root / should redirect to /en (or a language chooser—pick one and implement cleanly).

Layout requirements

Create a shared layout with:
Header
	•	Brand text: EN “Phnom Penh Opera”, KM “អូប៉េរ៉ា ភ្នំពេញ”
	•	Nav links: Home, Programme, The Festival, Sustainability, Contact
	•	Primary “Tickets” button linking to https://ppoi-front.vercel.app/
	•	Locale toggle (EN/KM) that preserves current path (e.g. /en/programme -> /km/programme)

Footer
	•	Festival name
	•	info@phnompenhopera.com
	•	+855 12 636 939
	•	Terms link /[locale]/terms-of-service

Page content (must be showable, not blank)

Home:
	•	Hero title + tagline + short quote/mission sentence
	•	Dates + venue section (placeholders ok)
	•	CTA row: Tickets + View programme
	•	“What’s on this site” (4 bullets)
	•	“Next updates” (coming soon)

Programme:
	•	Intro + list of programme items
	•	Prominent link to Don Giovanni page

Don Giovanni:
	•	Overview, dates/venue placeholders, cast placeholders, Tickets CTA

The Festival:
	•	About / mission / story sections

Sustainability:
	•	Intro + 4–6 bullet commitments

Cast:
	•	Simple cast list layout (TBC ok)

Sponsors:
	•	Sponsor tiers (Gold/Silver/Bronze) + partnership enquiry callout

Contact:
	•	Contact info + simple form (name/email/message) that doesn’t require a backend (front-end only)

Terms of Service:
	•	Structured placeholder terms (headings + bullets)

Design direction
	•	Premium arts festival vibe:
	•	warm cream background
	•	deep red primary
	•	gold accent
	•	elegant serif headings + clean sans body
	•	Consistent rounded cards, subtle borders, good spacing, mobile-first.

Deliverables
	1.	Working app with all routes above in EN + KM.
	2.	No 404s for listed pages.
	3.	Locale switch preserves path.
	4.	npm run build must pass.
	5.	Provide run instructions and any env vars (ideally none).

Proceed by:
	1.	scaffold project
	2.	create locale routing + layout
	3.	implement pages + translated copy object
	4.	style polish
	5.	verify build

If you want the strongest Replit result: after it scaffolds, tell it “show me the file tree and the exact commands you ran” so you can sanity-check quickly.
